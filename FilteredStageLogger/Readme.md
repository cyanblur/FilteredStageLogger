# Filtered Stage Logger

A plugin that lists all the items that exist in a stage once you load in. Currently, it does not list Casino Chests, AWU drops, or recycler rerolls. 

The mod will output the items in the console, (accessible in game with 'ctrl + alt + ~'), as well as create a ItemLogs.txt file next to the LogOutput.Log file.

It lists items and the source, along with highlighting for sought-after items or item combos (ex. `Bundle of Fireworks & Remote Caffeinator` will highlight both items should they both appear).

Configs for mod behaviors are available, use Risk_Of_Options for convenience.

This mod is a cheat, it'll make the game easier because you know the items, but by default you are not shown the items unless you use `check_stage #`
