# List Item Locations

A plugin that lists all the items that exist in a stage once you load in. Currently, it does not list Casino Chests, AWU drops, or recycler rerolls. 

The mod will output the items in the console, (accessible in game with 'ctrl + alt + ~'), as well as create a ItemLogs.txt file next to the LogOutput.Log file.

It lists items and the source, with a config to change it to NoItems, ItemsAndSources, NoItems, and a currently non-functional JSON output.

This mod is a cheat, it'll make the game easier because you know the items.
